this repository was a main refrence for and some of the files here including run_vae.py and get_z.py are adopted from "Tim Baumg√§rtner" implementaion of the VAE but there are some modification to be used for our purpose such as changing the data loader to be bale to trian on larger corporas without memory issue.
